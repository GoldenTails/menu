# menu.pk3

This code needs a rewrite *badly!* Are you up to the task? It has the potential to be much better!

It has some great coding decisions, mixed with some terrible ones.


To make a PK3 in the `builds/` directory, execute `./buildMenu.sh` in a Linux environment.

It requires that `zip` is installed on the system for it to work.


I originally coded this to release to the public in a stable form, but I've ended up releasing it in an unstable one instead.

Have fun, I guess?? --Golden
